title: Chapter 1: A Tree's leaves

# Beginning of the Season:


    At the start of the spring season trees are without leaves dropped from when the tree began its preparation for dormancy for the winter, in the autumn.
    The period of which a tree is dormant for depends on the local environment, geographical location and its species.


    The leaves will begin to react to the warmer temperatures and the increasing length of available daylight of their environment, the buds will start to open followed by the new leaves beginning to expand from these revealed buds.
    During this period the production of chlorophyll (the pigment that results in plants’ green colour) starts which brings about the process of photosynthesis in these newly developed leaves, triggering a period of rapid growth.
    As time progresses the colour of the leaves become stronger due to the abundance of nutrients available to the leaves through the tree and the amount of sunlight shining upon them.

## End of the Season:

    As spring transitions into the summer time and the increased high temperatures of daytime, the previously rapid growth slows down.
    This is due to enzymes behind photosynthesis not being able to function during the heat of the day, this is accompanied by the lower level of rainfall resulting in the lower soil moisture surrounding the tree’s roots.
