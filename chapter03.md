## Chapter 3: Bugs and Insects during spring

### Flies:

As the temperatures begin to rise after the cold winter, any snow and ice may begin to melt or defrost.
Often this can expose the previously covered up animal matter, be it their waste or their dead bodies. 
This is when common house fly will start to become more active, even before the spring’s first flower blooms, their activity is dependent upon how abundant food is for them. 
This is shown is the numbers of flies flying about during spring.

### Spiders

Spiders spend the winter typically in man-made structures such as homes, garden sheds.
They are often found nested within the home in places like attics, closets or even inside the walls of the structure itself.
They do this while they wait for the weather to get more bearable as it does in spring, they are quick to bolt out to the wider world.
Despite the fear or discomfort they often bring when seen, they are beneficial to have as they eat other insects like flies.

### Ants

Ants are one species that hibernate during cold months.
With the sudden drop of temperature in the winter, ants’ movements start to slow down gradually until the insect is in the hibernated state. Due to the hive traffic being drastically halted, the entrance gets blocked naturally.
However, once the spring temperature arrive, the reverse happens.
Ants will begin to recover from their slumber and start to slowly resume their previous work.
