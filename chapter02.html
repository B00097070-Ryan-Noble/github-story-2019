        <h2 id="weather&climate">The weather and climate:</h2>

        <p>
            During this transitional season between winter and summer, where we can see days getting longer, temperatures slowly increasing and plants blooming after the winter months.
            In the UK and Ireland during the spring months, the weather is typically dry and calm to due the heat loss from autumn to winter of the Atlantic.
            This leads to a reduce in heat and moisture transferred into the atmosphere.
            Due to the sun being higher in the sky, the temperatures rise during the day while staying cool at night, this is because of the warmer ocean temperature.
        </p>

        <h2 id="hemisphereDiff">The Hemispherical difference:</h2>

        <p>
            For countries in the Northern Hemisphere the season of Spring starts, astronomically, between the 19th of March and the 21st. With the season ending three months later in June.
            However for those int the Southern Hemisphere as north of the equator is expecting spring, they are having autumn due to the Earthâ€™s tilt resulting them into experiencing the shorter length of days.
            <br>
            The Southern spring is from between September 22nd and September 24th, lasting for the same 90 days, ending in the final fortnight of the year, around the 22nd.
            Places closer to the equator noticing less of a difference due to the lack of a large difference in day length.
