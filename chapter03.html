<h1> Chapter 3: Birds during Spring</h1>

<p>
    Birds are affected by the seasonal changes throughout the year.
    These changes are seen in bird’s behaviour, how they sing and the appearance, the colour of their feathers,
        all of which are dependent upon what season their habitat is experiencing.
</p>

<h2> Mating Season</h2>

<p>
    For most birds, spring is their typical mating season.
    Males can be seen to express the more noticeable of these changes, as they are at their brightest colour as they attempt to attract a mate.
    Even the bird species that retain their distinctive feather colours year-round, appear to be much brighter in the spring compared to autumn.
</p>

<h2> End of Spring & Mating Season:</h2>

<p>
    A bird specie’s songs are meant to attract a mate or declare their territory, the manner of which changes throughout the year based on if the bird is seeking a mate or caring for their young.
    In the spring the songs are quite vocal and often hostility between males as they challenge one another throughout the mating season. However once mates are chosen and nests are built along with any hatched eggs, the songs get quitter.
    An exception to this is calls that are about territories, otherwise the birds are tending to their nests and using all their energy in the search of food for their young.
