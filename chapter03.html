<h2 id="flies">Flies</h2>

<p>
    As the temperatures begin to rise after the cold winter, any snow and ice may begin to melt or defrost.
    Often this can expose the previously covered up animal matter, be it their waste or their dead bodies.
    This is when common house fly will start to become more active, even before the springâ€™s first flower blooms, their activity is dependent upon how abundant food is for them.
    This is shown is the numbers of flies flying about during spring.

<h2 id = "spiders"> Spiders:</h2>

<p>
    Spiders spend the winter typically in man-made structures such as homes, garden sheds.
    They are often found nested within the home in places like attics, closets or even inside the walls of the structure itself.
    They do this while they wait for the weather to get more bearable as it does in spring, they are quick to bolt out to the wider world.
    Despite the fear or discomfort they often bring when seen, they are beneficial to have as they eat other insects like flies.
