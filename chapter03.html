<h1> Chapter 3: Birds during Spring</h1>

<p>
    Birds are affected by the seasonal changes throughout the year.
    These changes are seen in birdâ€™s behaviour, how they sing and the appearance, the colour of their feathers,
        all of which are dependent upon what season their habitat is experiencing.
